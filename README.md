# Robust ML for Grid Operation
This repository contains code accompanying the paper "Robust Machine-Learned Algorithms for Efficient Grid Operation", including code for running experiments and generating figures. A part of this code - specifically, the cogeneration plant model, associated data, and utilities - is modified from the ``CogenEnv`` environment in the [SustainGym](https://chrisyeh96.github.io/sustaingym/) suite of reinforcement learning benchmarks.
